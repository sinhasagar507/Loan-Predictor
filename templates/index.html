        <h2>Top-Up Loan Predictor</h2>

        <p class="section-about__paragraph">
            A loan is when you receive the money from a financial institution in exchange for future repayment of the principal, plus interest. Financial institutions provide loans to the industries, corporates and individuals. The interest received on these loans
            is one among the main sources of income for the financial institutions. A top-up loan, true to its name, is a facility of availing further funds on an existing loan. When you have a loan that has already been disbursed and under repayment
            and if you need more funds then, you can simply avail additional funding on the same loan thereby minimizing time, effort and cost related to applying again. LTFS provides itâ€™s loan services to its customers and is interested in selling more
            of its Top-up loan services to its existing customers so they have decided to identify when to pitch a Top-up during the original loan tenure. If they correctly identify the most suitable time to offer a top-up, this will ultimately lead to
            more disbursals and can also help them beat competing offerings from other institutions.

        <!-- See if you will be adding visualizations -->
        <p>According to a
            <a href="https://www.import.io/post/what-is-data-visualization/">

        <p class="section-visualization__paragraph">
            Data visualization is the representation of data or information in a graph, chart, or other visual format. It communicates relationships of the data with images. This is important because it allows trends and patterns to be more easily seen. With the
            rise of big data upon us, we need to be able to interpret increasingly larger batches of data. Machine learning makes it easier to conduct analyses such as predictive analysis, which can then serve as helpful visualizations to present.
