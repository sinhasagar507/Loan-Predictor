## Project 
Loan Upsell Prediction using Machine Learning 
**Domain**: Finance

## Aim 
The project is an attempt at estimating the most appropriate time during which financial institutions can issue top-up loans to its customers. They will ultimately make more disbursals and may even be able to outperform rival offerings from other institutions if they can choose the most advantageous time to offer a top-up.





## Setup
